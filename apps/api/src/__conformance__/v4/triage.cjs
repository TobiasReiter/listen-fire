// Version 4's engine corpus tests ruled out: each asserted an internal shape
// that has since been refactored, with no difference an author can observe
// through validate, run, story or MCP output. Anything an author could observe
// is a version conditional instead, never an entry here.
// `file` is relative to this directory; `test` is the test's (or describe's)
// own title. On this branch the corpus is cloud-native's own live tests at
// c39a99d6 (the last commit before the merge that brought version 5), whose
// run.unit.test.ts already says the result's write record carries no `old`
// (B1), so main's entry for its stale copy has no test to name here.
